/// \brief This class sets the timestamps of a trajectory
/// to enforce velocity, acceleration, and optionally jerk constraints.
/// Initial/final velocities and accelerations may be specified in the trajectory.
/// Velocity and acceleration limits are specified in the model.
/// A jerk constraint may be passed into the contructor, which may be
/// overridden when the model supports this in the future.
///
/// This algorithm repeatedly fits a cubic spline, adjusts the timing intervals,
/// and repeats until all constraints are satisfied.
/// When finished, each trajectory waypoint will have the time set,
/// as well as the velocities and accelerations for each joint.
/// Since we fit to a cubic spline, the position, velocity, and
/// acceleration will be continuous and within bounds.
/// The jerk will be discontinuous, but within bounds.
///
/// If jerk is disabled, then initial/final acceleration matching
/// will be disabled.
/// You would use this if you want to allow bang-bang style control
/// where the controller can go from min acceleration to max acceleration
/// instantaneously.
/// In other words, discontinuity in the acceleration curve allowed.
/// Since the acceleration can change instantly, matching the initial and final
/// acceleration is unneccessary.
/// This will get the shortest paths and should be comparable to 'optimal'
/// methods that have a trapazoidal velocity curve.
///
/// However, jerk is enabled by default.
/// To match the velocity and acceleration at the endpoints,
/// the second and second-last point locations need to move.
/// By default, two extra points are added to leave the original trajectory unaffected.
/// If points are not added, the trajectory could potentially be faster,
/// but the 2nd and 2nd-last points should be re-checked for collisions.
/// The downside of enforcing jerk is that if the limits are low,
/// there will be visible oscilation
/// around what you may expect as the 'optimal' velocity curve.
/// Increasing the jerk limits will reduce oscilation and speed up execution.
